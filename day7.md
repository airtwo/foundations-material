Day 7 Review & Hackathon: Instructor Notes
==========================================

There are no slides for Day 7.

## The objectives for the day are:
- Assign a short in-class project that they can do in pairs and have them show or talk about their work at the end of class.
- If there is time: Talk about next steps for continuing to learn. You can point students to online resources, or recommend ways to expand on the assignments they've done in class. Each student's goals may be different, so allow students to set the standard for what you talk about on this topic.
    - examples of things to point students to: MDN's web development guide, Bootstrap, jQuery, Github and Code School's Try Git, the Frontend Focus newsletter from Cooper Press, anything on TreeHouse...anything else you like and can recommend!

## Hackathon!
The students should have one hour for this part, and they should work in pairs or groups of three. At the end of the hour, reserve 30 minutes (if possible; again, dependent on class size)

The goal of the assignment is to review skills learned in this course, to have time working in class with an instructor there to help, and to challenge the students to stretch a bit further by trying to do some new things.


### Project Options

Time is limited, so students should not use class time trying to decide what to do. You should choose one option that you think best for the class.


* Build a webpage for a donut shop!
  * _note to instructors:_ in the `day7-files` directory included in this repo you'll find a PDF of the completed page and a GIF demonstrating JS functionality that they can build into the site. Please share these with the students. The completed project and starter files are included here but also live on Glitch:
    * [Starter files with the project structure and assets on Glitch](https://donut-shop-starter-files.glitch.me)
    * [Completed project for your reference on Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/donut-shop)
* Return to something you built for homework during this course and work on it more during class. Ask questions and get help here! If you choose this option, you can choose to both work on the same project or each work on your own project, sharing what you've done and helping each other out.
* Build a simple reference page about CSS. Choose one or more properties to demonstrate, and use JavaScript to illustrate what different properties do using user input for the property values. For instance, you could have information about the "background color" property with color values in a [select element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/select), so that when a user selects a color, the background color for some node in the DOM is changed. The page itself should have a nice layout and styling.
* HARD MODE Build a very simple JavaScript clock using the [Date object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date). It should look like a standard digital clock, showing the hour, minutes, and seconds. Bonus: change the background color at a certain interval.
