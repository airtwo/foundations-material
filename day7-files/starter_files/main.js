// OVERVIEW:
// Register an event listener that listens for a click on the SPRINKLES! button. When someone clicks that button, a function should execute.
// That function, toggleSprinkles, is sketched out below


// Declare the function
function toggleSprinkles() {
  // YOUR JS GOES IN HERE!!
  // The purpose of this function is to add or remove the 'sprinkles' class on the 'topping' element (see index.html for this structure)

  // You'll need to find and select the DOM node where the class should be applied
  // Save it to a variable so you can refer to it easily inside this function

  // Once you have the element, see if you can add the 'sprinkles' class to it
  // Look in styles.css to see that class and see if you can understand what it does
  // If the element already has the 'sprinkles' class on it, it should be removed (in other words, you need to add/remove or TOGGLE, this class)
  // Here's some documentation that might be helpful to you:
    // https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList
}

// Something has to call that function! Remember Event Listeners?
  // Find the button to add/remove sprinkles and save it to a variable
  // Then add an event listener that will respond to a mouse click event (i.e., when someone clicks on that button)
  // When that event happens, it should execute the `toggleSprinkles` function
  // Here's some documentation for adding event listeners: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener
